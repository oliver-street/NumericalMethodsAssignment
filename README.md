All code can be run from 'assessmentCode.py'. This should produce various diagrams depicting linear advection (printing error norms), four plots of total variation against time for various courant numbers, print the time taken to run BTCS vs FTBS, and produce a plot of the l2 norm against dx for various schemes. You may have to close each graph before the next opens.
